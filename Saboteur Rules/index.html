            <h1>Saboteur Rules</h1>
            <hr>
            <div class="rules">
                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Each player has an active card slot and a permanent card slot. At the start of the game, each player draws two cards from the deck and 
                    chooses which card will be their permanent card and which card will be their active card. The game then commences with players each taking their turn
                    until there is a winner. You win the game by holding the Saboteur when the deck is exhausted, or if you are the last player standing
                    (meaning all other players have lost both their card slots).
                </p>

                <h2>Player Turn</h2>
                <p>
                    On your turn, you can choose to either draw or execute.
                    <br><br>
                    If you execute, you choose a player to execute. If you can guess their permanent card and their active card, the executed player loses a card slot,
                    and discards a card of their choice. They are then allowed to replace their remaining card with a new card from the deck. 
                    The unchosen card is shuffled back into the deck. 
                    However, if the person who used execute guesses the other person's cards incorrectly, that player loses a card slot instead and discards a card of their choice.
                    <br><br>
                    If you draw instead of execute, you draw a card from the deck and can choose to replace your active card with the drawn card. The unchosen card is discarded.
                    You can then use a card action. Note you can use any card action, not just of the cards you hold. However, your card action can be challenged.
                </p>


                <h2>Challenging</h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever a player uses a card action, any other player can challenge if they do not believe the player holds that card. If a player challenges a card action,
                    The person who used that action must reveal a card. 
                    <br><br>
                    If they reveal the respective card of the card action they used, the challenger loses a card slot and chooses a card to discard. The player who revealed a
                    card then has the choice to replace their new card with a card from the deck, and the unchosen card is shuffled back into the deck. The card action that 
                    was challenged is then performed as normal.
                    <br><br>
                    However, if the player is unable to show they hold the card of the action they used, they lose a card slot instead.
                    They discard the card they revealed.
                    The card action they used is cancelled.
                </p>

                <h2>Losing Card Slots</h2>
                <p>
                    Each player starts with two card slots. If you lose both card slots you are eliminated from the game. If you lose a card slot, 
                    no matter which card you chose to discard your remaining card slot will be your active card slot, and you will not have a permanent card slot.
                </p>

                <h2>Technicalities</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Saboteur Mechanics:</i> Note that as soon as the last card is drawn from the deck, the person holding the Saboteur is declared the winner.
                    Also note that you cannot discard the Saboteur by drawing, however, if you lose a card slot, you can choose to discard the Saboteur, 
                    and it is shuffled into the deck instead.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Double Kills:</i>
                    Note it is possible to lose both your card slots at once. For example, if player 1 uses Assassin on player 2, and player 2 challenges,
                    if player 2 loses the challenge, they lose a card slot and player 1's Assassin goes through. If Player 1 then successfully asssassinates player 2,
                    player 2 will have lost both card slots.

                    Similarly, if player 1 uses Assassin on player 2 and player 2 calls Countess, if player 1 challenges the Countess and player 2 does not have it,
                    player 2 loses a card from the challange. Then if player 1's successfully assassinates player 2, player 2 will have lost both card slots.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Changing Permanent Card:</i>
                    Note that there is only one way to change your permanent card during the game. If you win a challenge and revealed your permanent card, you are given 
                    the choice to replace that card. Otherwise, it is not possible to change your permanent card.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Collaboration:</i>
                    Players should not collborate with each other throughout the course of the game.
                </p>
