# Saboteur
A game I created and coded to play with friends. 

Use this link to play the game: https://ecstatic-boyd-abc2f3.netlify.app/
The rules are available as a link at the bottom of the page. You can also access them in the "Rules.html" file in the Saboteur Rules folder.

The game needs at least 2 players, but recommended to play with 4 - 6 players.

To enter the lobby, enter a username, this is what your name will be in the game.
The password is: svge

Once all the players are ready, you can press start game to start the game.
